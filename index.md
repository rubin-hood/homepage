Willkommen auf meiner Startseite.


Der digitale Wald, in dem Kreativit√§t und Technologie aufeinander treffen.

Welcome to my website showcasing my passion for IT projects.

This website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5 running PHP to provide a modern and interactive experience. The complete source code is available in my GitHub repository.

Many people find IT difficult to understand because much of its knowledge is complex or hard to access. Just like Robin Hood shared with everyone, Rubin-Hood shares IT knowledge in a simple way that anyone can understand. I want to help people learn about IT by making it clear and free for everyone - like a modern Robin Hood, but for tech knowledge.
